                <li>His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.</li>

                <li>In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. </li>

                <li>He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.</li>

                <li>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS).</li>

                <li>He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. </li>

                <li>Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (1997), followed by three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 – 7 March 2021), Mustafa Kalam ( 1999) and Kasim Mohammed (1995).
